<p>here are a list of some of the things i would like to get done this year…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Develop at least one mobile app</strong> and release it to a store of some sort or all 3 (iTunes, Windows Phone 7 and Android) this way i am attacking all 3 platforms…</li>
  <li>**Work on my own projects outside of work: **I have a few ideas, just need to sit down and work on them… similar to above, but most of the ideas are “services”… the apps above would probably talk to said services…</li>
  <li><strong>Move the sites outside of the network</strong>: Leave my home broadband for my personal use and host my sites in a proper datacentre, or even the cloud… only host test sites in house.</li>
  <li><strong>Use a language other than c# for programming</strong>: So, i can use C# to develop for Windows Phone 7, and with the help of Mono i can write for iPhone/iPad and Android also. But i also want to write in another language other than what i have used before. So, thats Java, C#, C/C++ out of the picture… F#? Ruby? Assembly? something new and different… Objective C even…</li>
  <li>**Take more photos: **My camera usually sits in it’s bag beside the desk and only comes out to play on occasion. I would like to get out more and take more photos. even if they are not top quality photos, just photos. the more i take, the more i learn.</li>
  <li><strong>Finally fix my room and desk once and for all!</strong> This place has become a nightmare to get around… There are machines I can see but physically can’t get to… Others have been on for years, but never upgraded…. I have a box in here still running win2k3! So, clear the room, rewire for proper network (cat6 and GigE) and try and get it as a nice place to work, sleep and watch movies…</li>
</ul>

<p>So, they are my resolutions. I Did something kind of <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/new-year-new-upgrades">similar last year</a>, and in the next few days i should probably go back and see how i got on… but they are my commitments for this year. We see how i get on… And more in the sprit of last years post, here are some random things i would like to do this year.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Get a new media centre box</strong>: need something that can record a lot of TV shows and move encoded video to the SAN… this should have a couple of satellite tuners (my current one has 2, ideally 4 would be better), BluRay drive (have one spare here), HDMI out with Audio (currently need to convert from DVI-&gt;HDMI and use optical or analogue sound out…) and enough horse power to re-code DVDs and BluRays quickly…</li>
  <li><strong>Build a SAN:</strong> Have the hardware, or at least most of it. Now to get it working… Thinking Open Solaris as the OS with ZFS as the file System. have a Dell Poweredge 2950 here with 8 hot swap hard drive bays and some other internal drives… i am planning on using this and an External SAS enclosure with a 8 port External SAS card to bring the drive count to 16. this <strong>*should*</strong> be enough for a while…</li>
  <li><strong>Rip ALL my DVDs and BluRays</strong> to MP4 and store them on the SAN so anything can stream them: XBox360, PS3 and AppleTV, as well as the Media Centre running Boxee… even if they get ripped as ISOs or folders, i have enough horse power in the house to convert these to pretty much anything… should be all good!</li>
</ul>

<p>Any comments, suggestions of the language i should pick, questions? leave comments!</p>
