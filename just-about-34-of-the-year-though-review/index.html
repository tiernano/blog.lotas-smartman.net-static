    <p>Right, so at the start of the year, i wrote a <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/my-new-year-resolution">post on the things i wanted to do this year</a>… Oddly enough, one of them was not blog more, which is something i haven’t done anyway… That post, which was posted at the start of January was only 6 posts ago! I really need to post more!</p>

<p>Anyway, quick round up of how its going…</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Develop at least one mobile app: **I have started on this, but not released anything. I have a project on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> i have been meaning to finish. I also have a bit of a <a href="https://github.com/tiernano/WinPhone7Demos">sample project with Windows Phone 7 Code</a> i started… I did get enrolled in the Windows Phone Developer program though College, so i just need to “pull my finger out” to get something finished…</li>
  <li>**Work on my own projects outside of work: **I have done some work outside of “work” work… I have some public projects on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, like the <a href="http://www.loggly.com">Loggly</a> Target for NLog (which i <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/announcing-the-release-of-a-loggly-target-for-nlog">posted about here</a>), <a href="https://github.com/tiernano/GitPushMSBuild">GitPushMSBuild</a>, which will (whenever i get around to finishing it) will allow you to do a git push to a repository, which will then kick off an MSBuild, erm, build…  I have some private Repos also, but i could tell you what was in them, but i would have to kill you…</li>
  <li>**Move the sites outside of the network: Done! **Finally, all my sites are running on a dedicated box in Germany from <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/">Hetzner</a>. Its an <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/eq4">Dedicated EQ4</a> with Quad Core i7, has 8Gb ram, 2 750Gb HDDs in RAID 1, got 100mb/s connection, IPV4/6 connectivity and is running Windows 2008 R2 Web Edition. As a second part of this, i have also started the move of my Exchange Box from In house to <a href="http://www.office365.com">Office365</a>. No more managing of Exchange for me! well, physical machine management anyway!</li>
  <li>**Use a language other than c# for programming: **Ok, so in College last semester, I wrote code in Java. I also wrote some Java code for work. I am also looking into coding in CUDA though a course from Stanford on GPU programming, which is mostly C++.</li>
  <li>**Take more photos: **Right… I have actually taken a few more photos this year than i though… Putting them online is a different story… The last set of photos i posted this year, taken this year, was on <a href="http://photos.geekphotographer.com/Holidays/St-Patricks-Day-2011-Random/16231532_JSsPMm#1219345172_rPvwc">Paddy’s day of random cars and trucks i seen around</a>. the last one previous to that was from <a href="http://photos.geekphotographer.com/Travel/Hard-Rock-Cafe-Time-Square/16233891_dfpwLG#1219503006_LsaEn">New York last year</a>…</li>
  <li>**Finally fix my room and desk once and for all! **Currently in the process of doing this (I swear!) Most of my machines are off, i can see and get to parts of my room i haven’t been able to get to in years, and i have the desk (mostly) picked out… the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ie/en/catalog/products/S79887464">Ikea Vika Amon / Vika Curry</a> seem to be what i want… Now all i need to do is get to finish what i started…</li>
</ul>

<p>There were some Random things i wanted to try get done also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Get a new media centre box: **Got a small Media Centre a while back. Don’t know what its called, but its a Dual core Atom, has about 2Gb RAM, runs Windows 7, has HDMI with audio out and does the job i want it for, which is, currently, play videos using <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a>. </li>
  <li>**Build a SAN: **I have the hardware, just haven’t finished it… like a lot of my Spare time stuff…</li>
  <li>**Rip ALL my DVDs and Blu-rays: **The problem with this one is 2 fold: one: i don’t have a DVD or Blu-ray player in the GodBox, my most powerful machine… i reckon it would encode a DVD or Blu-ray fairly quickly… And second: without the SAN, i am running out of space quickly… So, first is to finish the SAN. then, put a Blu-ray drive in the GodBox and start ripping!</li>
</ul>

<p>SO, overall, getting there… I will try post a bit more also… Im just a Lazy git… <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /></p>
